An XPIA (Cross Platform Inference Attack) targets machine learning models like Microsoft Copilot for Outlook by exploiting vulnerabilities in how these models process and infer information. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how such an attack might work when targeting Microsoft Copilot for Outlook:

Attack Overview

	1.	Reconnaissance: The attacker first gathers information about the target system, understanding how Microsoft Copilot integrates with Outlook and identifying potential vulnerabilities. This involves examining the APIs and endpoints Copilot uses to process emails and provide suggestions.
	2.	Crafting Malicious Inputs: The attacker crafts specially designed inputs, such as emails with specific content or formatting that might trigger unintended behavior in Copilot. These inputs could be designed to manipulate Copilot’s natural language processing (NLP) models.
	3.	Exploiting Model Weaknesses: By sending these malicious emails, the attacker aims to exploit weaknesses in Copilot’s NLP models. For instance, the crafted inputs might cause Copilot to misinterpret the email content, leading to incorrect suggestions or actions that benefit the attacker. This could involve injecting malicious commands disguised as regular text or exploiting biases in the training data.
	4.	Gaining Control: Once the model starts making erroneous inferences, the attacker can exploit these to gain further access or control. For example, if Copilot suggests inappropriate responses or actions based on the attacker’s crafted emails, the attacker might gain access to sensitive information or cause the user to perform unintended actions.
	5.	Persistence and Exfiltration: The attacker might use the foothold gained through Copilot to establish persistent access to the victim’s system and exfiltrate sensitive data. This could involve using Copilot’s responses to pivot to other parts of the Outlook environment or the broader Microsoft 365 ecosystem.

Example Scenario

	1.	Phishing Email: An attacker sends a phishing email designed to look like a legitimate business communication. The email contains hidden malicious commands in the form of seemingly benign text.
	2.	Model Exploitation: Copilot processes the email and, due to the crafted input, misinterprets it as a command to forward sensitive information or to download a malicious attachment. The email might use specific wording that the model has been trained to recognize as a legitimate request, but in a context that triggers a harmful action.
	3.	Action Execution: The user, trusting Copilot’s suggestion, might unknowingly execute the suggested action, such as forwarding the email to another address controlled by the attacker or opening a malicious attachment.
	4.	Data Exfiltration: Through this chain of events, the attacker can exfiltrate sensitive information from the user’s account.

Mitigation Strategies

	•	Robust Model Training: Ensuring that the models are trained on diverse and comprehensive datasets to minimize biases and vulnerabilities.
	•	Regular Security Audits: Conducting regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and fix potential weaknesses in the integration of AI models with email systems.
	•	User Education: Educating users about the potential risks and encouraging them to verify the actions suggested by Copilot, especially when dealing with sensitive information.
