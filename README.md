Rename scriptedAI.py to pickle_rick.py
1. Create the Python Script:

Open a text editor of your choice (e.g., Notepad, Sublime Text, VS Code).
Copy the Python code provided in my previous response and paste it into the editor.
Save the file with a .py extension, for example, sagemaker_interaction.py.
2. Create the Documentation (README.md):

Open another text file in your editor.
Use the following structure and fill in the details:

# SageMaker Endpoint Interaction Script

## Description

This script demonstrates how to interact with a deployed SageMaker endpoint using the Amazon SageMaker SDK (boto3) in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- boto3 package (`pip install boto3 sagemaker`)
- AWS credentials configured with access to SageMaker resources

## Usage

1. **Replace placeholders:**
   - Update `endpoint_name` with the name of your deployed SageMaker endpoint.
   - Update `region_name` with the AWS region where your endpoint is deployed.
   - Modify the `data` variable according to your model's input format. 
2. **Run the script:**
   - `python sagemaker_interaction.py`

## Notes

- Ensure that the input data format matches what your deployed model expects.
- The script assumes the endpoint response is in JSON format. Adjust accordingly if necessary.

## Example

```python
# Example input data (modify as needed)
data = {"text": "This is a sample text for prediction."}

# Example prediction response (format may vary)
{"predicted_class": "Positive", "probability": 0.95}
